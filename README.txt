Data and scripts for Vlah et al. 2018

To replicate SI figures, go into path_to_repo/SI/mixing_models and run 1_correction_phase.R and 2_assemble.R. You'll have to change a few directory pathways in each of these files so that they match your system. Then run 3_mixing_phase.R through line 287. You can plot figures below on lines 309-600. The rest of the script after this point has not been curated and is full of bugs, but you can see a few other plots and diagnostics in the "more plots" section beginning on line 608.

The sensitivity analysis and associated files are contained in path_to_repo/SI/mixing_models/sensitivity.

FA analyses are in path_to_repo/FA.

Apologies for the disorder of this repo. If you have any questions or comments, please email Mike Vlah at vlahm13@gmail.com.
